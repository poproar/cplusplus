I started to refactor this program yesterday.
Trying to wrap my head around headers and multiple files.
WOndering when an object becomes an object.

As I try to set up the login function I am finding that
the goto x,y screen layout is just a waste of time, effort and system resources
so now I am going to simplify this process although I do think colors are helpful
