this repo is based on assignments at school.
I might use this to refactor or better practice in the future.

Most of these programs were written in Visual Studio 2010 and run cmd line.



## Employee Record System

### What is it
-----------

This is a Modularized Console Application. Data that reads an input file   and fills appropriate arrays. Default files contain 30 records containing   the following fields: First Name, Last Name, Middle Initial, Employee   ID#, State, ZIP, hours worked, and rate of pay. After proper transfer of   data this program can then further do the following :

  - Data can then be sorted by ID# or Last Name.
  -	Rapid reporting of the highest and the lowest paid employees.
  -	Summaries of the total hours worked and pay.
  -	Individual records can be searched by Last name or ID#.
  -	Reports can be generated. /ERS/print/ directory

This system was built with C++  to run on a WindowsÂ® based machine with   controlled access.
Though this program is operational there are some known bugs.
